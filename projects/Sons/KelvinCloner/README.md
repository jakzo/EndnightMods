Press `ALT + K` to spawn a new Kelvin and build your own army of workers.

Hold `ALT` while giving an order to broadcast it to all Kelvins. You only need to hold `ALT` when pressing the interact button, not while selecting on the notepad.

Notes:

- Spawned Kelvins persist across saves. ðŸ‘Œ
- There is no hotkey to despawn Kelvins. If you need to do that, well... you know what you have to do. ðŸ’€
- I haven't tested with multiplayer but I think it might work. ðŸ¤·
