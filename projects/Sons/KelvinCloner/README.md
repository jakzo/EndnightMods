Press `ALT + K` to spawn a new Kelvin and build your own army of workers.

Notes:

- Spawned Kelvins persist across saves. ðŸ‘Œ
- There is no hotkey to despawn Kelvins. If you need to do that, well... You know what you have to do. ðŸ’€
- I haven't tested with multiplayer but I think it might work. ðŸ¤·
